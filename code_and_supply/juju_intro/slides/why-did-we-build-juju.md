##  Why did we build Juju?

We want to orchestrate all the way up and down the stack.

- Deploy a solid foundation <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Juju-Ception?! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Make Services the first-class citizens they are <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

note:
    Provide the plumbing and get out of the way
    Deploy workloads ontop of the plumbing
    Consistent Deployment Language to speak to your efforts
    the 2001 style 'stay up all night reading blog posts and pulling out hair'
