##  Orchestration is Agility

- Reconfigure a service through relations
- Evolution of scale, peers become self aware
- The barrier to entry is reduced


note:
    How many people have setup big data?
    How many people have looked at Discourse?
    With clearly defined relationships, expertise is not required.
    Share operational knowledge with peers
    Distill away that knowledge into data-pass operations and context
    sensitive configuration
