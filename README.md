# PublicPresentations
My personal collection of presentations. The living/breathing repository of my public speaking tools (Vendored into the Canonical archives if your phobic of personal namespaces)

### Development Setup

I use nvm to install dependencies for my generators.

    nvm install 0.10.31
    npm install -g yo grunt-cli grunt bower
    cd <presentation>
    bower install && npm install
    grunt serve
